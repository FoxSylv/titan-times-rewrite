            Hello everyone! I know it has been quite some time since we’ve had one of these, but I am glad to finally have my own 
            edition of the Times to share with all of you! It has been a long time (and a lot of procrastination on many fronts) in the
            making, so if you’re seeing this, it means I finally rubbed some brain cells together.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I’m sure most of you are aware at this point, the new hierarchy was rolled out a few weeks ago! It’s simpler and easier to follow than the one prior, so hopefully no one is too confused anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            In case you didn’t know, it works like this:

            Basically, the cabinets aren’t woven into the hierarchy anymore, so ranking up is based more on activity! You can still join any of the 3 cabinets separately too. Also, the cosmetic roles still exist separately from all other roles, which are based only on the length of time you’ve been a part of the guild. If you have more questions about the new system, ask any member of Council!
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, there have been some notable promotions since the new hierarchy was put into effect. Be sure to give some congratulations to these members!

            We also just had another Gartic Phone event, which was a huge success. I suspect we’ll be seeing more of these in the future, so keep an eye out on the events channel if you want to join in the future!

        <h2>
            Military Updates
        </h2>
        <p>
            With the end of Season 5 upon us, I thought I’d give a recap of how ANO made out. Our military team was able to successfully defend our ocean claim for the season, and we had a good amount of relative peace. ANO made it into the top 10 for the Season Rankings, ranking 6th overall. Congrats to everyone that helped out this season, and let’s hope for another success next season!
        </p>
        <p>
            This was also our first season being a part of the new Cucumber Company war alliance! While there were a few adjustments to member guilds partway through, overall we worked together to hold our claims.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’re interested in helping out with the war effort or participating in FFA during offseason, consider asking a Council member for military roles to get started and always feel free to ask questions!
        </p>
        <h2>
            Main Stage
        </h2>
        <p>
            The thing I wanted to talk about most this edition, the recent formation of our new community alliance with ESI, Adonis! With the decline of our other community alliance, Hestia, the leaders of ESI and ANO decided we needed a space for those of us who are still active to hang together. Hestia is still around, but our events team will be planning alliance events for Adonis only from now on.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do have a Discord server if you haven’t already joined! Ask a council member for an invite if you’d like to check it out (this is not mandatory however, but we do get up to some shenanigans in <code>#counting</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
            We recently had our inaugural event, a Trivia night! This one was hosted by the ESI events team, and I was actually able to attend (unlike most events we host cause they’re at bat shit wild times for us EST people). I very much enjoyed our first event and I hope to see all of you at the next one!
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the ESI team hosted the first event, that means it’s on us to plan and host the next one for Adonis, so if you have any interest in that, consider applying for Spirit if you have some ideas!

            : Did you know that when Mars rover Curiosity sang “Happy Birthday” to itself on its first anniversary of being on the planet? This technically makes Curiosity’s solo birthday wishes the first song to be played on another planet.

            If you’ve made it this far, thank you! I was really unsure about taking over the Times on my own, and spent a lot of days putting it off because I didn’t want to fall short of anyone’s expectations I hope this was an enjoyable read for you all, and if you liked it, then keep your eyes peeled for the next edition in the future. Also if there’s something you’d like to see as part of the next publication, feel free to toss your suggestions to me or any other Brilliance member. Or, if you think you’d like to be a part of the production of our newspaper, apply for Brilliance! Once again, thank you for reading this one and I hope you’ll look forward to many more to come!
