            It has been a long time (and a lot of procrastination on many fronts) in the making,
            so if you’re seeing this, it means I finally rubbed some brain cells together.
        </p>

            As I’m sure most of you are aware at this point, the new hierarchy was rolled out a few weeks ago!
            It’s simpler and easier to follow than the one prior, so hopefully no one is too confused anymore.
