            Recent Happenings üìÖ
        </h2>
        <p>
            First up, promotions! I love this part because I get to talk about the guild members that have really stepped it up recently. There‚Äôs a good handful this go around <strike>
                since this has been rewritten so many times
            </strike>. Niel1299_TW, RowansWorld, ThrowMusket, Galassia98, explosivegamer25, TM20, Dr_san, wabbalubbadubdub, vxzzy, Gushh, iBug, and Varuhkt have all been promoted to Sorcerer! Additionally, Aemor and Asoart have made the jump to Artificer! Congrats everyone, and let‚Äôs get some new names up here soon!
        </p>
        <p>
            As I‚Äôm sure all of us know by now, the Hero Beta is available for anyone who has Hero or Champion rank. At the time of writing, there are 4 classes that are playable (sad no shaman), and new patches are coming regularly until the release of the new update. If you‚Äôre able to play and haven‚Äôt yet, I highly recommend giving some of the features a spin!
        </p>
        <p>
            I‚Äôm also fairly certain most people know this too, but the SMP with our friends over in Adonis has been out for about a month now make your bets now for whether or not SMP will be dead by the time this comes out. It‚Äôs a 1.19 vanilla server and is just a fun space for alliance members to hang outside of Wynn. If for some reason you‚Äôre not in the Adonis discord, make sure you use the invite link in #guild-info and join the shenanigans (and definitely not just so I have more people to count with)!
        </p>
        <p>
            Staying with news from Adonis for another moment, ESI members planned a Wynnguesser (same concept as Geoguesser, but using the Wynncraft map) event. Participants were given either images or short video clips of a location in game, and were asked to provide approximate coordinates within 30 seconds. 3 of the top slots were held by ANO members, so congrats to Cal, Geb, and Micah!
        </p>
        <p>
            A fun surprise recently was another Crab Game event hosted by LaMDaKiS! Me being at work at the time, I couldn‚Äôt personally attend, but Crab Game is always a popular choice amongst guild members (and even people outside ANO), so of course it was a success. Make sure you grab the events role so you don‚Äôt miss any surprise events like this one!

            Military Updates ‚öîÔ∏è
        </h2>
        <p>
            I want to start this section off by giving a massive congrats to ChristmasBear for passing the strategist test! The test isn‚Äôt as simple as one might think, and new strats do not come by often. Nice job dude!
        </p>
        <p>
            It has been a few weeks at this point, but it‚Äôs still notable to mention our 5th place standing at the end of Season 6! This is higher than the previous season, so it‚Äôs awesome to see our war teams more active this time around. LaMDaKiS also came on top in Ocean Trials, our seasonal event in which you can earn LE for warring! Make sure you grab the role in #military-info if you‚Äôre interested in participating this season (or in any future season).
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Season 7 reclaim of the ocean went smoothly. However, we have 3 new territories in our claim this season: Jofash Docks, Aldorei Valley West Entrance, and Light Forest West Lower; that officially makes ours a 30 territory claim instead of 27!
        </p>
        <p>
            As always, if you don‚Äôt have the military role and would like it, just ask any council member for access!

            Main Stage: Hero Beta Patches üåé
        </h2>
        <p>
            With  multiple patches having been released at this point, I wanted to get some of the guild members‚Äô thoughts on the content we‚Äôve seen thus far, and some predictions for the future. Most of the members interviewed this round have Hero+ rank and have played the beta, but not everyone was! Overall, ANO members seem to be excited for the final release of Spellbound, but let‚Äôs see what our thoughts are on the patches!

            If you made it this far, thank you! The support of my fellow guildmates is what keeps me motivated to continue creating for you all. I hope y‚Äôall look forward to reading each volume as much as I look forward to writing them. As always, if there‚Äôs something you think should be included in the next volume, DM me! Or if you‚Äôre interested in helping write, add visuals, or just want to help out the publication in general, consider submitting a Brilliance application. It‚Äôs currently just me writing and Aezuh helps with getting visuals and publishing on Github. But the two man team never fails nonetheless! Once again, thank you all and I hope to catch you in the next one.
