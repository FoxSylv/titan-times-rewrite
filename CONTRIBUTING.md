# How To Contribute

## Posting issues

Use our [discord](https://discord.gg/h8XUHkR) for tracking bugs and feature requests. When posting a new issue, please:

* Check to make sure it's not a duplicate of an existing issue.
* Create a separate "issue" for each bug you are reporting and each feature you are requesting.

## Posting pull requests

If you are posting a pull request, please:

* Do not combine multiple unrelated changes.
* Check the diff and make sure the pull request does not contain unintended changes.

If proposing a major pull request, start by posting an issue and discussing the best way to implement it. Often the first strategy that occurs to you will not be the cleanest or most effective way to implement a new feature.

## Closing issues

If you believe your issue has been resolved, you can close the issue yourself. If your issue gets closed because a PR was merged, and you are not satisfied, please open a new issue.


# "Should I Contribute?"

## Yes!

Even if you are brand new to `react`, `tailwind`, or anything used to make the website, please feel free to help out! As long as you know the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS, then everything else isn't too hard to work with! And, working with them is a great way to learn and gain experience! ^w^

## I've never contributed to anything before.

That's perfectly okay! Everyone starts somewhere, even if it's just a typo fix. I can promise you that we'll be more excited that a new person is helping out rather than scrutinizing your level of experience.

## What should I work on?

Until the rewrite is complete, take a look at the roadmap on our [discord](https://discord.gg/h8XUHkR)! After completion, all issues and feature requests will be hosted there as well.
